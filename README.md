# API-Weather-App

**Description:**
I developed an API Weather App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which fetches real-time weather data from a weather API. The app provides current weather conditions, temperature, and forecasts for any location entered by the user. Key functionalities include:

- **Real-time Weather Data:** Users can input any city name, and the app fetches real-time weather information from the weather API, displaying current conditions, temperature, and forecasts.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal viewing experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Interactive and Engaging UI:** A modern and visually appealing interface with smooth user interactions and colorful design elements.

This project highlights my abilities in front-end development, API integration, and responsive web design.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML
- CSS
